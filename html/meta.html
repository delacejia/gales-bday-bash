      <div class="flavor-text">On the eve of her anniversary of traversing ‘round the earth’s orbit, 
        Galex had a chance encounter at a destined location. After leaving the scene, she suffered a flushed face, 
        strong heart palpitations, and a desire to watch more Hallmark movies. 
        Her friends reported that she seemed ‘lovesick’ and ‘lost in the sauce’. 
        A doctor gave her a diagnosis for 
        her symptoms, however, the doctor’s handwriting was essentially illegible. It seemed to say:</div>
      <div class="nav"><h2>BLNZJXPCTTG</h2></div>
      <div class="flavor-text">Confused, Galex yelled, “indéchiffrable! Just tell me what I have!” </div>
      <div class="flavor-text">“Come back tomorrow,” the doctor told her. “Your diagnosis will have changed by then anyway.”</div>
