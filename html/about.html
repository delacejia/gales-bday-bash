          <p>Hiiiiiii and what it doooooo üéâ</p>
          <p> Happy birthday!
            I hope you enjoy this smol puzzle hunt! It's a fusion of the puzzled pint 
            style (4 medium difficulty puzzles + 1 meta) and the MIT mystery hunt (some
            puzzles have little direction, and need some searching). Feel free to solve w
            frens, answer checker in the actual website may or may not happen by the time I
            send this but until then there'll be a Google Form to check answers üï¥Ô∏è
          </p>
          <p> A FAIR WARNING: The B2 puzzle hunt went through playtesting before release. This 
            puzzle hunt has not. You may find mistakes and puzzles that are ??? stupid easy ??? annoyingly vague ???
            mildly questionable??????? but hopefully still solveable. Difficulty is intended to be about the same as the
            B2 puzzle hunt but with less guidance. </p>
